# Arothron
Tools for geometric morphometric analysis. The package includes tools of virtual anthropology to align two not articulated parts belonging to the same specimen and to build virtual cavities as endocast. In addition we supply functions to import and export the coordinates of landmarks and 3D paths into 'landmarkAscii' and 'am' format files.
